# OpenCLI

The OpenCLI specification (OCS) defines a standard, platform and
language agnostic interface to CLI applications which allows both humans
and computers to understand how a CLI tool should be invoked without
access to source code or documentation.

## Usage

* Create documentation for CLI tools
* Generate clients for interacting with CLI tools
* Automate external tools such as MCP servers
* Detect changes in CLI APIs

## Contribute

The OpenCLI specification is currently a draft, and we need discussions 
with the community to make sure that the first version can be as good as possible.

Head over to our [discussions][discussions] if you have feedback or ideas!
